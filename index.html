        <h2>High School 🏫</h2>
        <p>
          Being able to see and talk to you everyday was the best part of school. I looked forward to every class we had together. Time wouldnt flow in the days you were absent. I wouldnt even notice the end of SSP when talking to you.
          P.S. I would have never agreed to this photo if it werent for you :D

        <h2>First Date 🇨🇴</h2>
        <p>
          I was really stressed for our first date. I wanted to try out spanish food a lot because they always talk about how good it is. You looked really cute on our first date. I still remember it so clearly. Regardless of how much I struggled to eat that dish, it was still veryyy good. I kinda wanna go there just thinking about it now. I loved watching you with the rain in the back. It was really cute.

        <p>
          I thought you looked absolutely gorgeous with your outfit that day. I was so stressed throughout the whole time. Im so glad that I went to prom with you, best decision yet imo. Prom night sleepover was even better, I remember having smile lines the morning after from how happy I was.
          IM really lucky to have sat next to you >_<

          Thank you for going on a trail with me. It was the most fun I've ever had being on a trail. I was really glad I could go through the park with you, just talking and enjoying the peace. Thank you for going even though you were scared to.
